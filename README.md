# FreeCodeCamp - Relational Database

## Certification Project - Build a World Cup Database

This is one of the required projects to earn your certification. For this project, you will create a Bash script that enters information from World Cup games into PostgreSQL, then query the database for useful statistics.

Create a GitHub account if you don't have one. You'll need it when you create the virtual Linux server machine. This process may take a few minutes.
Complete both steps below to finish the challenge.

## Step 1: Complete the project

- The project runs in a virtual machine, complete the user stories described in there and get all the tests to pass to finish step 1.
- Important: After you pass all the project tests, save a dump of your database into a worldcup.sql file, as well as your insert_data.sh and queries.sh files, so you can complete step 2. There will be instructions how to do that within the virtual machine.


## Step 2: Submit your code

- When you have completed the project, save all the required files into a public repository and submit the URL to it below.
